The script uses the RPi.GPIO library to control the moisture sensor and water pump, and the requests library to get the weather forecast from OpenWeatherMap API.

The check_moisture() function reads the moisture level from the sensor and compares it to the minimum moisture level before watering, and the check_forecast() function uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather forecast and check if it is going to rain.

The water_plants() function checks both the moisture level and the forecast and turns on the water pump if it is necessary to water the plants.

Please note that this is just a sample script and you will need to fill in your own API key and location for the weather forecast, and adjust the pin numbers and minimum moisture level to match your specific setup.

Also, you have to import time library too.
